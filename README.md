"# Noise-algorithms" 

Contains a test version of the perlin noise aglorithm, whcih generates cubic noise at given coordinate. 
Also contians a GLSL version to do the computation on the GPU, where multiple coordinates are done in parallel to render a surface(the surface can be a game landscape or clouds or something.
