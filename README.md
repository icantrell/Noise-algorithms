"# Noise-algorithms" 

Contains a test version of the perlin noise aglorithm, whcih generates cubic noise at given coordinate. 
note:Normally this is done as GPU computation, where multiple coordinates are done in parallel to render a surface(where the surface is a game landscape or clouds or something.).
