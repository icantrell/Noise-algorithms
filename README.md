"# Noise-algorithms" 

Contains a test version of the perlin noise aglorithm, whcih generates cubic noise at given coordinate. 
Also contians a GLSL version to do the computation on the GPU, where multiple coordinates are done in parallel to render a surface(the surface can be a game landscape or clouds or something.
<br>

To run this type<br>
<b>python perlin_noise.py</b><br>
this will should bring up a 4d plot of the alogithm which looks like moving terrian.
